					<h4>My First Program as a Developer</h4>
					<hr>
					<p>My first program was created in highschool using Java. The program consisted of a simple text displayed to the screen saying "Hello World!". While taking other classes based on computer maintence, I practiced on mastering Java. As time flew by and I started to take college courses I learned a new language called C++.</p>

					<p>As I started to take more courses in my community college, more computer languages started emerging and I started learning. Before I knew it I was able to script in Java, C++, Assembly Launguage, and HTML.</p>

					<p>It just shows to see that I am someone that likes to learn and develope along the way.</p>
